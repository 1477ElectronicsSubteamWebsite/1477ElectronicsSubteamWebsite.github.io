Welcome to the website of Texas Torque's Electronics Subteam! We are the students that run everything that lights up, moves, makes sound, and arguably is cool on the robot. This website serves as a database for FRC teams, new electrical rookies, and people curious about electronics. 

Information regarding individual modules can be found along the navigation bar. Rookie learning interactives can be found under [Rookie Help](https://carolinenilorac.github.io/rookiehelp). Troubleshooting for a specific module is detailed on the module page.
