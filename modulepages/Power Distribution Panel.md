The panel that was used most commonly from its debut in 2015 until the reveal of the new REV system. 16 ports of pure, absolute, bliss. 

### REV Robotics PDH

REV's new PDH debuted for pre-order in November 2021 along with the rest of their new 2022 FRC electronics system. However, is compatible with the REV system including the radio power module, the Pneumatic Hub, and the new auto reset breakers. Now compatible with the new REV mini power module.

### Troubleshooting

##### Won't turn on:

Check breaker lines (Make sure it's getting power)

##### Not supplying power to one module:

Verify that there is a breaker/fuse. Next, ensure the connection to the module is complete.

##### Not connecting to the CANbus:

This is where things get more complicated. To verify the strength of  the CANbus, connecting with REV Sparkmax client is the easiest way to check for a break between modules.
