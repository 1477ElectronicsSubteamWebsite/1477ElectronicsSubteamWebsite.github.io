### CTRE VRM

Powers the little things on the robot that the PDP cannot, such as Raspberry Pi's, LED strips, and Arduinos. POE's and barrel plugs for the radio and other modules get their power from here.

### New REV Mini Power Module

Functions similarly to the VRM, with enhanced compatibility with the REV system. Offers 6 channels to power additional modules on the robot.

### Troubleshooting

##### Won't turn on:

Verify the connection powering the module. Check crimps, fuse, etc.

##### Not delivering power to a certain module:

First, make sure it is in giving the correct amount of voltage required for that module. Next, verify the connection by checking crimps and wire.
